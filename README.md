Run this program using g++ compiler \
Step 1: Run this command to compile the file \
        ```
        g++ main.cpp -o assembler
        ```

Step 2: Run the executable file **assembler.exe** using the following command 
        assembler.exe \
        ```
        <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE> <LISTING FILE>
        ``` \
        ```<INPUT FILE>``` is a required argument and is the name of the file which we need to read.\
        I have attached input.txt with my code which contains the sample input for the program.\
        Here ```<OUTPUT FILE>``` and ```<LISTING FILE>``` are optional arguments and by default will take 
        output.txt and listing.txt values.\
        Here using ```<OUTPUT FILE>``` you can name the output file according to your wish.\
        Using ```<LISTING FILE>``` you can name the listing file according to your wish.\
        Here if you want to add ```<LISTING FILE>``` then you have to add ```<OUTPUT FILE>``` also.\
        Sample command: \
        ```
        assembler.exe input.txt output.txt listing.txt
        ```

Step 3: After the assembler successfully assembles the code, I am asking for the program address.
        The user has to provide us with the program address in hexadecimal format.

Step 4: Check the **output, listing, memory.txt, memory_visualizer.txt** files created in the same directory whose name is either equal to their default values
        output.txt and listing.txt or equal to the names given by you during the execution.

**opcodes_file.txt** contains the opcodes and their corresponding values. So if you want to add, delete or edit opcodes, you can directly edit this file.\
**memory.txt** file contains the view of our memory where I have shown the values and their corresponding addresses i.e. all instruction's generated object codes and addresses are shown.\
**memory_visualizer.txt** contains the actual view of our memory where data stored at all the addresses is shown.\
Thus these files also takes into account the execution address related to our program.
